# Executive This Function (ETF) v5

A platform focused on building infrastructure for "scout brains" - enhancing neurodivergent strengths while scaffolding executive function.

## About the Project

Executive This Function is exploring the "Scout Brain Hypothesis" - the idea that what's often labeled as executive dysfunction may actually represent cognitive adaptations optimized for exploration, discovery, and innovation.

Rather than trying to "fix" these traits, we're building tools and environments that work with these cognitive styles, enhancing their strengths while providing just enough support for executive function challenges.

## Features

- **Scout Brain Hypothesis**: Research into neurodivergent cognition as an evolutionary adaptation
- **Interactive Tools**: Experiments like Mind Mirror to help users understand and work with their cognitive states
- **Essays**: In-depth explorations of neurodivergent cognition and design
- **Spatial Design**: Concepts for physical environments optimized for neurodivergent cognition
